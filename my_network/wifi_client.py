@brief Asynchronous Wi-Fi client management for ESP32.

@details
This file provides functions for the ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network, disconnect from it,
and retrieve network configuration details.

Primary Functions:
- connect: Connects the ESP32 to a specified Wi-Fi network.
- stop: Disconnects the ESP32 from the current Wi-Fi network and deactivates the station interface.
- get_default_gateway: Retrieves the default gateway IP address from the current network configuration.
