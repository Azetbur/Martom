@brief Creates and manages an access point with a web server.

@details
This script includes functions to asynchronously create and run an access point with a given SSID and password,
using the ESP32's networking capabilities. It also contains functionality to start a simple web server that can serve
web pages and handle HTTP requests.

Primary Functions:
- ap_create_and_run: Sets up and runs the access point and web server.
- ap_stop: Stops the access point and server, deactivating the network interface.

    Asynchronously creates and runs an access point with the given SSID and password, and starts a simple web server.

    This function initializes and configures a new wireless access point using the provided
    SSID and password. It then activates the access point to allow devices to connect. After
    the access point is active, it starts an asynchronous web server listening on port 80.
    The server handles incoming HTTP requests and serves web pages.

    :param ssid: The SSID (name) of the access point to create.
    :param password: The password for securing the access point.

    :note: This function is asynchronous and should be awaited. It continuously runs the web server
           in an infinite loop, handling incoming client connections and serving web content.

    :note: Ensure that the function 'handle_client' for handling client connections is defined
           and properly set up to manage incoming HTTP requests.
